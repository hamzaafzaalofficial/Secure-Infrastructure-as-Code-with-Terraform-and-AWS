# Secure-Infrastructure-as-Code-with-Terraform-and-AWS

Implementing an infrastructure setup on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). Here's what I built:

- **Launched an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023**
- **Created an S3 bucket with enhanced security controls**
- **Set up a MySQL RDS database**
- **Implemented AWS KMS encryption across all services**

This automation significantly adds in the business value by right management of resources, which helps business cost optimization.
